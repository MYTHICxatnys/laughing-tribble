            console.log(`The value of j is: ${j}`);
            j++;

        let skipNum = 7;

        while (l < 10) {

        }

        //This avoids the infinite loop...understand why.


        //For loops:

        //for (iterator; condition; incrementor){
            //logic here
        //} end of loop

        //Let's build one:

            //console.log(`This would create an infinite loop as I will always be equal to 10.`);

        //Arrays:

        let arr1 = [4, 5, 6, 7];
        let arr2 = ['Apple', 'Orange','Banana', 'Pear', 'Watermelon'];

        //Accessing the last item of an array:
        let lastItem = [arr1.length -1];
        //Because we start from 0 and end 1 less than the length
        //In the above example the value 4 is stored at index 0 so
        //The value 7 is stored at the index of 3.
        //The length of the array however is 4.
        //So the last item is in the index of 3 which is the same
        //as saying arr1.length - 1 because 4 - 1 = 3.


        //Array methods:
        // indexOf(),includes(),concat(),join():
        
        //If we know the value of one of the items of the array, we can find where it resides with indexOf():

        console.log(arr1.indexOf(7));
        // If the value doesn't exist, we will get -1
        // If there are multiple indexes with the same value
        // then it will return the index of the first one only.

        //Similarly we can use the includes() method to see if the //array contains an item: if it does we get a true result 
        //if not, we get a false:

        console.log(arr1.includes(19));
        console.log(arr2.includes('Apple'));
        
        //To merge the elements of two different arrays into one 
        //new array we can Use the .concat() method:
        console.log(arr1);
        console.log(arr2);
        let arr3 = arr1.concat(arr2)
        console.log(arr3);

        //The .join() method returns the elements inside an array
        //as a string with each element separated by a comma:
        console.log(arr3.join());
        let arr3ToString = arr3.join();
        console.log(`The contents of Array3 are:
        ${arr3ToString}`);
        //All of the above methods for manipulating arrays were
        //non mutating - they do not alter the array(s). Below we 
        //will look at methods that do mutate the array(s) they 
        //are used on.


        //Mutating Array Methods:
        //PUSH() POP() SHIFT() UNSHIFT():
        // Add or remove items from the array:

        let arr4 = ['a','b','c','d'];
        //We can add to the end of an array with push():
        console.log(arr4);
        arr4.push('e');
        //It also returns the index position of the value we've added.
        console.log(arr4);
        //We can remove an element from the end of an array with
        // the pop() method:
        arr4.pop();
        console.log(arr4);
        //It also returns the item that was removed - in this case 'e'.
        
        //We can store the popped item in a variable:
        let removed = arr4.pop();
        console.log(arr4);
        console.log(`${removed} was popped off the end of arr4`);
        arr4.push(removed);
        console.log(`${removed} was placed back into the array: ${arr4}`);

        //We can also push more than one items in at once by using
        //a comma to separate them:
        arr4.push('e','f','g','h');
        console.log(`We can also push multiple items in using the push() method with each items we want pushed into the array separated by a comma: ${arr4}`);

        //While pop and push operate at the END of the array, we
        //can also modify the START or an array by using shift() and unshift():
        
        //We can store the shifted letter in a variable:
        let shifted = arr4.shift();
        console.log(`${shifted} was removed from arr4 using the shift() method: 
        ${arr4}`);

        //We can then add items to the front of the array using 
        //unshift():
        arr4.unshift(shifted);
        console.log(`${shifted} was returned arr4's front using the unshift() method: 
        ${arr4}`);

        //unshift() will also return the new length of the array.

        const pets = ['dog', 'cat', 'fish'];

        //Iterating through arrays:
        //Standard for loop:
        for(let i = 0; i < pets.length; i++){
            console.log(pets[i] +' indexed at: ' +i );
        }

        //for of loops:
        for(const pet of pets){
            console.log(pet + ' indexed at: ' +pets.indexOf(pet));
        }

        //Iterate over and mutate the values in the array
        //For loop:
        for(let i = 0; i < pets.length; i++){
            pets[i] = pets[i].toUpperCase();
        }
        console.log(pets);

        //Other methods to explore:
        //map()
        //filter()
        //reduce()
        //find()
        //forEach()
        //These use more advanced concept - callback functions.

        //Functions:
        let myName = 'Mythic';
